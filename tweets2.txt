In Octavio et al[m], the authors implemented a convolutional neural network(CNN) in real time in a robot
platform which has limited hardware capabilities for Emotion and Gender Classification. They proposed two
CNN models. Both models were designed with the idea of creating the best accuracy over number of
parameters ratio. The first model did not have any fully connected layers because the fully connected layers
contain most of the parameters in a CNN. The last convolutional layer had same number of feature maps as
the number of classes which was followed by an average pooling layers to reduce the number of parameters
followed by a softmax layer to give the output prediction. They got an accuracy of 96% IMDB gender dataset
and 66% on the FER-2013 emotion dataset. They used guided-gradient back-propagation proposed by
Springenberg et al[n] to visualise the features learned by CNN.
